# Earthbounder Maker

Tool I made for me to create levels for my game, "[Earthbounder](http://kevinpageau.com/earthbounder)". Move entities around and click on "Generate Code".

Created sometime in 2014.



## Try it

[Try it here](http://kevinpageau.com/earthbounder-maker)



## How to use

* Arrow keys to move character around
* `wasd` to move the viewport around
* `1`, `2`, `3` will change mouse "mode" to "Add", "Move" and "Delete", respectively
* `E` will place a horizontal ruler where the mouse is, locking platform entities' movement horizontally
* `R` will do the same vertically
